# Simulation sometimes can go weird‚Ä¶

What could go wrong with $\dot{x} = f(x, u, t)$?

<v-clicks>

### Why my simulator blow up?
### Why my robot sink into the floor?
### Why my block slip away from robot‚Äôs hand?
### Why the simulation is not deterministic?

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
simulation is mature, why are we still need to understand it?
because it do simplifications. 
some are necessary, while others leads to artifacts. 
if you encounter those

# Basics

## Coordinate, Discretization, Euler-Lagrange Equation


---

# Coordinate

<v-clicks>

### Minimum/Generalized Coordinate

Representation: in joint space $q, \dot{q}, \ddot{q}$

- ‚úÖ Minimize the number of variables, used on most of the simulators
- ‚ùå Hard to compute constraints

### Maximum/Cartesian Coordinate

Representation: in task space $x, \dot{x}, \ddot{x}$

- ‚úÖ Intuitive and easy to derive for simple system
- ‚ùå Leads to more constraints, extra computation

### Example: pendulum

$q = \theta, \dot{q} = \dot{\theta}, \ddot{q} = \ddot{\theta}$

$r = [x, y]^T, x^2 + y^2 = l^2$

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
First, 
Since simulator is used to predict the next state, we shall first figure out how the simulation represent the state. 
here are two common representation:

# Integration


$$
\dot{x} = f(x, u, t)
$$

<v-clicks>

## Explicit Integration

Euler: $x_{n+1} = x_n + \Delta t f(x_n, u_n, t_n)$
- üëç Easy to implement, easy to calculate gradient 
- üëé Diverge in energy

RK4: $x_{n+1} = x_n + \frac{\Delta t}{6} (k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)$
- üëç More stable, more accurate
- üëé Still diverge in energy, also $n\times$ evalutation time. 

</v-clicks>


::right::

<v-clicks>

## Implicit Integration
 
Solve $x_{n+1} - x_n - \Delta t f(\frac{x_{n+1}+x_n}{2}, u_n, t_n) = 0$

- üëç Stable, conserve energy
- üëé Hard to calculate gradient

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
Secondly, we always have to discretize the simulation to solve it numerically. 
Two methods: 

From upper to lower: more expensive, but more accurate. 

closing: now, with the basics, we can take a look at how to simulate a multi-rigid-body system in the next section.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-rigid-body System

## How would an unconstrained system evolves over time?

<!-- 
The second part of will be about the simulation of contact-free system. 
With that, you know how it evolves in the air with external force. 
 -->

---

# What is Euler-Lagrange Equation

## Newton's law for general system

<v-clicks>

Newton's law: $M\ddot{q} - \nabla V = 0$

Euler-Lagrangian Equation: $\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = 0$

- $L = T - V$
- $T = \frac{1}{2} \dot{q}^T M(q) \dot{q}$: kinetic energy
- $V$: potential energy

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
Dynamics, first time in mind: Newton's second law. 
(click)
Newton's second law is the most intuive way to describe the dynamics of a system. 
But how to generalize it to the multi-link systems? are we going to calcuate the force/torque for each joint? 
 -->


---

# Why Euler-Lagrange Equation over Newton's Law

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = 0
$$

<v-clicks>

- Optimization formulation: convert simulation problem into a calculating L
- Coordinate invariant
- Clear physics interpretation: least action principle $\min_q \int L(q, \dot{q}, t) dt$

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
part from less variable number, E-L equation dominate the physics simulation for other reasons:

 -->

---

# Physics Interpretation of Euler-Lagrange Equation

## Least Action Principle, Hamilton's Principle

$$
\min_q \int L(q, \dot{q}, t) dt, \quad L = T - V  \\
\text{s.t.} \quad q(t_0) = q_0, q(t_1) = q_1
$$

<v-clicks>

- Explain how the system evolves from one state to another
- Choose a kinematics path such that: the average of kinetic energy and potential energy is minimized.
- Least action principle describe global behavior of the system, while Euler-Lagrange equation describe local behavior. They should be consistent. (can be proved. )

</v-clicks>

<img src="./assets/least_action.png" style="width: 30%; margin: 0 auto;" alt="least action"/>

<!-- 
But you may ask, where does this E-L equation come from? turns out it's the result of Hamilton's principle. 
the physical intuition is that...
 -->

---

# Lagrangian Dynamics with External Force

"Lagrangian-D'Alembert" principle, aka "virtual work principle‚Äú: 

$$ {0|1|all}
\begin{aligned}
\partial_q \int L' dt & = \partial_q \int (L + F^T q) dt = 0 \\
 \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L'}{\partial \dot{q}} - \frac{\partial L'}{\partial q} & = F
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- 
Up to now, our system does not have any external force. 

Now, we have a full form of E-L equation. 
 -->

# Special Case: E-L Equation for multi-joint rigid body system


<v-clicks>

## Articulated rigid body:

$$
L = T - V = \frac{1}{2} \dot{q}^T M(q) \dot{q} - V(q)
$$

## Manipulator Dynamics

$$
M(q) \ddot{q} + C(q, \dot{q}) \dot{q} + G(q) = \tau
$$

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

- Used in most of the simulators, you can read those value from urdf parser. 
- $M(q)$: inertia matrix
- $C(q, \dot{q})$: Coriolis matrix
- $G(q)$: gravity term (sometimes integrated into $C$, called that "dynamic bias")
- $\tau$: joint torque
- Computationally expensive, $O(n^3)$ for $n$ joints, sometimes is sparse and can be reduced to $O(n)$. 

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
The above E-L equation is the most general form. 
For simple multi-link systems, the kinematic structure can be exploited to simplify the calculation. 
 -->


---

# Example

## Cart-pole

$$ {0|1|all}
\begin{aligned}
L & = \frac{1}{2} m_1 \dot{x}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 \dot{x}^2 + \frac{1}{2} I_1 \dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2} I_2 \dot{\theta}^2 + m_2 g x \cos \theta \\
\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} & = M(q) \ddot{q} + C(q, \dot{q}) \dot{q} + G(q) = \tau \\
M(q) & = \begin{bmatrix}
m_c + m_p & m_p l_p \cos \theta \\
m_p l_p \cos \theta &  m_p l_p^2
\end{bmatrix} \\
C(q, \dot{q}) & = \begin{bmatrix}
- m_p l_p \dot{\theta}^2 \sin \theta \\
0
\end{bmatrix} \\
G(q) & = \begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
- m_p g l_p \sin \theta
\end{bmatrix} 
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- 
to see how it works, let's take a look at an example. 
 -->

---

# Constraints in E-L Equation

## Equality Constraint

<v-clicks>

$$
c(q, \dot{q}) = 0
$$

with equality constraints, the E-L eqn. is:

$$
\partial_q \int L' dt = \partial_q \int (L + \lambda^T c(q)) dt = 0 \\
\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L'}{\partial \dot{q}} - \frac{\partial L'}{\partial q} - \lambda^T \frac{dc(q)}{dq} = 0
$$

- $\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier (**constraint force**) 
- $J(q) = \frac{dc(q)}{dq}$ is the Jacobian matrix of the constraint. 

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
one last thing we haven't talked about is equality constraints. 
When your system is closed loop or with tendon, you will have to constraint the relative position between some links. 
 -->

---

# Final Version of Manipulator Dynamics

## Manipulator Dynamics

<v-clicks>

$$
M(q) \ddot{q} + C(q, \dot{q}) \dot{q} + G(q)  = \tau + J(q)^T \lambda
$$

## KKT Condition

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
M & -J^T \\
J & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\ddot{q} \\
\lambda
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
\tau - C(q, \dot{q}) - G(q) \\
-\frac{d}{dq} (J(q) \dot{q}) \dot{q}
\end{bmatrix}
$$



## Notes: 

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

- $J(q)$ is introduced since the constraint is applied in the maximum space, need to transform to the joint space.
- For system with equality constraints, the final form of manipulator dynamics can be solved explicitly without iteration. 

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
Now, we have a full form of manipulator dynamics. 
To solve that...

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-rigid-body System

## Takeaway

$$
M(q) \ddot{q} + C(q, \dot{q}) \dot{q} + G(q)  = \tau + J^T \lambda
$$

<v-clicks>

- **First principle**: Minimum action principle, everything can be derived from it.
- **Forward Dynamics is easy**: multi-rigid-body system + equality constraints = explicit solution. 
- More interesting things: 
  - Dual form: Hamiltonian Dynamics
  - Discretization: Legendre Transform, Variational Integrator

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Contact

## The brightest jewel in the crown of simulation

<!-- 
Now, we will take a look at the most interesting part of dynamics, contact.

# Why contact is such a headache?

## Impact = infinite acceleration/force

<!-- 
to give you a brief idea about why contact is so hard, let's first consider the most simple case: 

no longer contious, infinite acceleration/force.

# Why contact is such a headache?

Impact is not the only thing that causes non-continuous behavior.

# Time-stepping Method

<v-clicks>

## Solving a Constrained Optimization Problem

$$
\min_q \int L(q, \dot{q}, t) dt \\
\text{s.t.} \quad q(t_0) = q_0, q(t_1) = q_1 \\
\quad c(q, \dot{q}, t) \geq 0
$$

- If $c$ only has impact and no friction, the problem is convex. 
- The problem could be non-convex due to the friction cone. 

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
generally speaking, the contact solver is a constrained optimization problem. 
it solve the least-action problem with additional constraints. (i.e. friction, contact constraints)

as for the problem convexity, it depends on the type of contact model you use. 

for most of the time, the contact is non-convex, which cause the problem hard to solve. 

now, let's take a closer look at the friction cone. 
 -->

---

# Handle Friction


<v-clicks>

## Maximum Dissipation Principle

The optimization problem solve for friction (dissipation means the energy loss in the system)

$$
\min_b \dot{T} \\
\text{s.t. } b \le \mu n \\
$$

</v-clicks>

<img src="./assets/undetermined_friction.png" style="width: 50%"/>

<!-- 
friction could be underdetermined since multiple frictions could lead to the same joint force, especially for the system with multiple contacts. 
fortunately, we have a rule to solve it: maximum dissipation principle. 
 -->

---

# Handle Friction

## SOCP Formulation

$$
\min_b \dot{q}^T M b \\
\text{s.t. } b \le \mu n \\
$$

<v-clicks>

- When $\|b\| = 0$, the solver would fail. So we can use conic primal-dual interior point method to solve it. 
- A simple hack: use a smoothed 2-norm: $\|b\| = \sqrt{b^T b + \epsilon^2} - \epsilon$. 
- Impact, friction and q can be solved at the same time. 
- SOCP is NP-hard. 

</v-clicks>



---

# Further Simplify the Contact Problem

## LCP Formulation

linear approximation of friction cone. 

$$
\|b\|_1 \le \mu n
$$

By introducing a new variable $d$, the problem can be written as a LCP problem:

$$
b = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix} d\\
[1 \ 1 \ 1 \ 1] d \le \mu n \\
$$

![alt text](./assets/lcp.png)

---

# Further Simplify the Contact Problem

## LCP Formulation

<v-clicks>

- Problem is still non-convex, NP-hard. 
- But there are better solver can handle it. 
- Used in most of the simulators. 

</v-clicks>

![alt text](./assets/lcp.png)

<!-- 
But SOCP is still NP-hard and hard to solve. 
In most modern simulators, the friction is further approximated by the linear form. 
by introducing a new variable...
 -->

---

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Contact

$$
\min_q \int L(q, \dot{q}, t) dt \\
\text{s.t.} \quad q(t_0) = q_0, q(t_1) = q_1 \\
\quad c(q, \dot{q}, t) \geq 0
$$

## Takeaway

<v-clicks depth=2>

- **Contact solver is a constrained optimization problem**: most of time it is non-convex. 
- **Contact always comes with approximation**: 
  - knowing what kind of approximation the solver is using can help you better understand the behavior of the system. 
  - But even the best solver, the contact is always approximated in the solving stage to make it tractable. 
  
</v-clicks>

> we haven't even mentioned the contact detection yet, which is another big topic. 


<!-- 
Now, to conclude this part, we added another components into our E-L equation: contact.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Case Study

## X-Ray of Common Simulators: Mujoco, PhysX

<!-- 
To finalize classic dynamics tutorial, let's take a look at two common simulators: Mujoco and PhysX. 
 -->

---

# MuJoCo

- Contact solver: smoothing method + extra constraints. (i.e. multiple string model)

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\dot{v}, \dot{\omega}) & = \arg \min_{(x, y)} \left\| x - M^{-1}(\tau - c) \right\|_M^2 + \| y - a_{\text{ref}} \|_R^{-1} \cdot \text{Huber}(\eta) \\
\text{subject to} \quad & J_E x_E - y_E = 0, \\
& J_F x_F - y_F = 0, \\
& J_C x_C - y_C \in K^*.
\end{aligned}
$$

<v-clicks>

- üëë Open source, clean JAX implementation, easy to modify and blinding fast
- ‚úÖ Differentiable, contact force always available
- ‚úÖ Lots of options to regularize the contact solver, could be very realistic (tons of contact modes `condim`)
- ‚úÖ Problem is always convex, easy to solve
- ‚ùå Hard to control, hard to manually tune the contact parameters
- ‚ùå Ecosystem: GPU pipeline rendering, generative model support, etc. 

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
First, let's take a look at Mujoco, which is the most common choice for RL tasks. 
Mujoco is a smoothing method we mentioned before, but with extra tweaks. 
It can handle multiple constraints system solve for the contact induced acceleration by considering every constraints. 

Here is the optimization problem it solve:
 -->

---

# PhysX

- Contact solver: time-stepping method, contact modelling with LCP
- Solver: Projected Gauss-Seidel (1st order, like coordinate descent)

<v-clicks>

- ‚úÖ Open source (but issac series is not)
- ‚úÖ Board learning community, first GPU-based simulator
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive API and features
- ‚ùå Less modular
- ‚ùå The implementation is hard to read. Also, the wrapper is heavy. 
- ‚ùå Little bit hard to deploy, binding to distro and nvidia. 

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
Another simulator is PhysX, most people used for sim2real today since it is the first GPU-based simulator. 

Compared with mujoco, it use a more standard time-stepping method to solve the contact problem. 

As for friction, it is approximated by a linear form. 

As for the contact solver, it is a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem. 

 -->

# Conclusion of Classic Dynamics

$$
\min_q \int L(q, \dot{q}, t) dt \\
\text{s.t.} \quad q(t_0) = q_0, q(t_1) = q_1 \\
\quad c(q, \dot{q}, t) \geq 0
$$

<v-clicks depth=2>

- **The problem it solves**: a non-convex optimization problem but can be convexified. 
- **The approximation they made**:
  - discretization
  - mass regularization
  - contact softening
  - friction linearization

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
To conclude this tutorial, I hope you can remember this equation, which every simulator shared in common. 

As for the end user, you should also know
discretization: when blow up, choose integrator
mass regularization: when system is too stiff
contact softening: choose right parameter
friction linearization: always take a look at the friction cone. 

Happy to take any questions!
